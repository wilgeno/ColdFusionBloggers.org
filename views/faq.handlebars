<b>Where's Ray and who's maintainging this now?</b><br />
Raymond Camden decided to step away from this in May of 2018. He graciously offered it up to someone else if they wanted to host and maintain the service. 
I stepped up and together we migrated ColdFusion Bloggers to my AWS hosting account. Some of you know me as Wil Genovese, others know of my blog Trunkful.com. 
I am the current caretaker.

<p>
<b>Is there a ping service?</b><br />
Yes. To ping this site, first figure out the <i>exact</i> URL we have on record for your blog. You
can find this on the <a href="feeds/">Feeds</a> page. Then simply set your blog software to ping:
</p>
<p>
http://www.coldfusionbloggers.org/ping.cfm?burl=YOURURL
</p>
<p>
If it worked correctly, you will get an &quot;Ok&quot; response.
